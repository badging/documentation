# Review Checklist

This page contains information about the Review Checklist and how a reviewer could collect the information required for the Review Checklist criteria.

### **Purpose of Review Checklist**

The review checklist provides a guideline for the reviewers to verify the event's alignment with CHAOSS Diversity and Inclusion best practices.

The event checklist for the CHAOSS Badging Project can be found [here](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/checklist.md).

### Working with the Review Checklist

D&I Badging reviews are checklist-driven. A review checklist will be generated for each reviewer to work through when reviewing the submission. Reviewer tick the checkboxes which they think the event aligns with the criteria.  The review process completes when **the applicant is satisfied with the current badge status** and **will no longer provide more information**.

Reviewers can always ask applicants for more information through an issue comment.

#### **Initial Check**

Make sure all the initial checks are marked before proceeding with Metric based checks. If the event is not qualified with all the initial checks, call the moderator team to end the review.

* **Event information is publicly available on a website.** Observe the event website to see whether the event information is public.
* **The Event Code of Conduct is publicly available.** Try to find the Event Code of Conduct in person on the event's website or other public places, if you have difficulty with that, you may need more consideration of this checkbox.
