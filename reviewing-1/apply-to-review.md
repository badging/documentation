The reviewer form requests the following personal information:

* **Your Name:** Supply your full name. D&I Badging will not share the name with applicants or spread it unless you are willing to post your name on the website.
* **Your GitHub Handle:** This will be later added to the reviewer list in [reviewer.md](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/reviewers.md) file under the badge/event-diversity-and-inclusion repository once you become a member of the reviewer team.
* **Your Email Address:** D&I Badging uses your email address to contact and communicate with you, and will not share or publish it on the website.
* **Your Organization\(optional\):** You can choose not to share this information with us. D&I Badging asks for the organization to know the further background about you, and will not share or publish it on the website.

Below are the most important questions:

* **Who you are and why you're interested in the CHAOSS D&I Badging Program.** 
* **Your history with Diversity & Inclusion in Open Source.**

We will also ask:

* We want to know if you would like to include your name on our website as CHAOSS D&I Badging Program Reviewer. If you agree with that, your name will show on the bottom of [D&I Badging Page](https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/).
* We also require you as a reviewer to identify and act upon any conflicts of interest. Please see [D&I Badging Conflict of Interest Policy](d-and-i-badging-conflict-of-interest-policy.md).

The D&I Badging team will be notified once you submit the form, and will contact you through email to set up a meeting to explain the reviewing process. The meeting also includes our motivation and the role of the reviewer in more detail.

After the meeting, your GitHub handle will be added to the list of [current reviewers](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/reviewers.md).
