# The Review Process

This page contains information about the Review Checklist and how a reviewer could collect the information required for the Review Checklist criteria.

### **Purpose of Review Checklist**

The review checklist provides a guideline for the reviewers to verify the event's alignment with CHAOSS Diversity and Inclusion best practices.

The event checklist for the CHAOSS Badging Project can be found [here](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/checklist.md).

### Working with the Review Checklist

D&I Badging reviews are checklist-driven. A review checklist will be generated for each reviewer to work through when reviewing the submission. Reviewer tick the checkboxes which they think the event aligns with the criteria.  The review process completes when **the applicant is satisfied with the current badge status** or **the applicant will no longer provide information**.

Reviewers are encouraged to ask applicants for more information through an issue comment.

#### **Initial Check**

Ensure all the initial checks are marked before proceeding with Metric based checks. If the event is not qualified with all the initial checks, call the moderator team to end the review.

* **The Event is about Open Source technologies and systems.** This is not always easy to understand without talking to the event team. In most cases, this can be explained by the event website in combination with the applicant's description. Ask the applicant if you need more information.
* **The Event information is publicly available on a website.** Observe the event website to see whether the event information is public.
* **The Event Code of Conduct is publicly available.** Try to find the Event Code of Conduct on the event's website or other public places.
* **The applicant is the organizer of the event.** The applicant must be involved in the planning and development of the event.

* **Displaying demographics**: This should only be checked if the event openly displays data regarding their speaker demographics. This could be in a PR statement, press release, or otherwise, but it must be reasonably easy to find.
