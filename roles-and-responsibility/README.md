# Badging Roles

## Roles

Different roles undertake different part of responsbilities in D&I Badging workflow. Badging roles are: **applicants, reviewers, moderators, maintainers.**  Responsibilities concerned here are to make sure submissions and reviews are working well, specifically for the GitHub related section of the workflow. 

Applicants and reviewers are the most fundamental and indispensable roles of D&I Bading, since they consist the core sections of the badging workflow: applying and reviewing. Beside this, we also need moderators to coordinate between applicants and reviewers, and maintaniners who are responsible for the whole project.
