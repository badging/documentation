# Badging Roles

## Roles

Different roles undertake different responsibilities in D&I Badging workflow. The Badging roles are **applicants, reviewers, moderators, and maintainers.**  These roles exist to ensure submissions and reviews are smooth and efficient. This is especially true for the GitHub section of the workflow. 

Applicants and reviewers are the most fundamental and indispensable roles of D&I Badging since they are a part of the core sections of the badging workflow: applying and reviewing. Besides this, we also need moderators to coordinate between applicants and reviewers, and maintainers who are responsible for the whole project.

Click the following tab bar to see the definition of each role.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Applicant" %}

{% tab title="Reviewer" %}
A reviewer is a person who reviews the submission, complete the checklist, and gives feedback through issue comments.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Moderator" %}
A moderator is a person who facilitates the interaction between the applicant and the reviewer within an issue.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Maintainer" %}
A maintainer is a person who takes overall responsibilities within D&I badging project, making sure everything works regularly.

{% endtabs %}

As most of the responsibilities are related to the workflow on GitHub, it's important to understand that each role has its GitHub permission that specified what can do and what should be avoided. See the permission table below.
