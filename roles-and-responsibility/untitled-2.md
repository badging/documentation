## FAQ

`Q` What kind of commitment is reviewing for Event Badging?  
`A` We see a lot of variables affecting this time commitment, including our number of reviewers and number of applicants. We expect, at the highest load, for the project to require about 20 minutes every few days from each reviewer. At lowest, we'd expect 20 minutes or so every few weeks

`Q` We are looking forward to more questions!
