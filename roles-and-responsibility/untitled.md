## FAQ

`Q` What kind of commitment is maintaining for Event Badging?  
`A` Maintaining the project requires sufficient command of the Badging workflow and long-term connection to the community. We expect, at the highest load, for the project to require about 20 minutes every couple of days for each maintainer.
