# Applying for a badge

**Events** refer to tech get-togethers, conferences, festivals, and any other tech event that promote tech-related concepts, mostly off-line meetups, but digital events are also included given in certain circumstances.

Currently, we only support D&I badge applications for **events**, but we will cover project applications in later versions.

## The Application Guide

Describe how you should submit the event application and waiting to be reviewed\(cover almost the complete workflow\)

1. Navigate to [the CHAOSS Event Badging submission form](https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/)
2. Fill out the web form to your best ability and click "Submit".
3. An issue template will be created for you with the information you provided. Click "Create New Issue" to begin the application.
4. Communicate with the reviewers during the process and provide Event information according to the metrics your event committed to.
5. Your event will be assessed by at least two reviewers, and a badge will be generated for you.
6. Comment `/result` on the Application any time during the review to see the badge you have been assigned.
7. Call `@badging/badging-moderators` team when you have implemented reviewer feedback and they have made changes accordingly to the Review Checklists, or at a point in time where you wish to end the review.
8. The review ends when a moderator confirms that the initial checks are met. The issue is closed when the  `/end` command is issued by a moderator.
