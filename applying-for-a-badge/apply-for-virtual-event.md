# Apply For Virtual Event

We make one distinction between virtual events and in-person events. The Virtual Event does not have the ability to measure the [Family Friendliness](https://chaoss.community/metric-family-friendliness/) metric because this is not currently a concern for virtual events.

## In-Person Event Badge Submission Form

## Basic Information

* **Event Name:** Use the most commonly mentioned and well-known name of the event.
* **Link to the Event Website:** The link should be valid, publicly available on a website, and show the event information. We recommend providing the home-page link.
* **Provide verification that you are an event organizer:** Only the organizer is eligible to apply the badge on behalf of event participants. Please provide substantial proof to show you are the organizer of the event you are applying for. A link with your name displayed as an organizer on the event website is ideal.

## Metric-related Information

This section requires you to provide **Diversity & Inclusion Metrics** related information of your event. 

The In-Person Event D&I metrics are:

* Speaker Demographics
* Attendee Demographics
* Code of Conduct at Event
* Diversity Access Tickets

If your event commits to one of the following metrics, please tick the checkbox, then fill the subsequent boxes under each question. We also provide **criteria** under each metric in the form for you as references of what the reviewer will be considering when reviewing the submission. 

### Speaker Demographics

_How well does the speaker lineup for the event represent a diverse set of demographics?_

* **Detail the process for measuring Attendee Demographics**. 
* **Provide the link for the page related to Attendee Demographics if available.** 

### Attendee Demographics

_How diverse and inclusive are the attendees?_

* **Detail the process for measuring Attendee Demographics.**
* **Provide the link for the page related to Attendee Demographics if available.**

### Code of Conduct at Event

_How does the Code of Conduct for events support diversity and inclusion?_

* **Is the code of conduct posted at Event venue?** You can answer simply Yes or No. But more details are suggested.
* **Provide the link for the Event Code of Conduct.** It's essential that you provide the link because CoC\(Code of Conduct\) is an initial requirement for D&I badge application. Without the link, reviewers may determine your event as not-passing.

### Diversity Access Tickets

_How are Diversity Access Tickets used to support diversity and inclusion for an event?_

* **How many different types of diversity access tickets are available for the event?**
* **What are the criteria for qualifying for a diversity access ticket?**
* **Provide a link to the page containing information about Diversity Access Tickets.**
