# Apply For Virtual Event

We make one distinction between virtual events and in-person events. The Virtual Event does not have the ability to measure the [Family Friendliness](https://chaoss.community/metric-family-friendliness/) metric because this is not currently a concern for virtual events.

## In-Person Event Badge Submission Form

## Basic Information

* **Event Name:** Use the most commonly mentioned and well-known name of the event.
* **Link to the Event Website:** The link should be valid, publicly available on a website, and show the event information. We recommend providing the home-page link.
* **Provide verification that you are an event organizer:** Only the organizer is eligible to apply the badge on behalf of event participants. Please provide substantial proof to show you are the organizer of the event you are applying for. A link with your name displayed as an organizer on the event website is ideal.

## Metric-related Information

This section requires you to provide [**Diversity & Inclusion Metrics**](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/) related information of your event. 

The Virtual Event D&I metrics are:

* Speaker Demographics
* Attendee Demographics
* Code of Conduct at Event
* Diversity Access Tickets
* Schedual Diversity

If your event commits to one of the following metrics, please tick the checkbox, then fill the subsequent boxes under each question. We also provide **criteria** under each metric in the form for you as references of what the reviewer will be considering when reviewing the submission.
